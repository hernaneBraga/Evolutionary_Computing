# Evolutionary Computing
Repository for the evolutionary computing course at UFMG in 2020/1. Mainly topics include Combinatorial Optimization, Genetic Algorithms (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

These are all the projects implemented in Python Notebooks step-by-step:

1. [N-queens problem:]() an introduction into genetic algorithm concepts using the classical n-queens problem.

2. [Solving a Knapsack problem](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Evolutionary_Computing/tree/main/2%20-%20Knapsack%20Problem) using a GA with a roulette wheel to rank solutions.

3. Using a GA to start at a random string and gets to the Hamlet sentence 'Methinks it is like a weasel'. [The classical Weasel Program](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Evolutionary_Computing/tree/main/3%20-%20Weasel%20Program).

4. Using the [Differential Evolution method](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Evolutionary_Computing/tree/main/4%20-%20Differential%20Evolution) to solve the non-convex and multimodal function rastrigin and peaks function. 
 
 5. Implementing a [Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)](https://github.com/hernaneBraga/Evolutionary_Computing/tree/main/5%20-%20Particle%20Swarm%20Optimization) method and applying it to the rastrigin and peaks function.
